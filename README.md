I cloned this promotional email sent from Udemy's marketing department. It promotes their reasons for 
people to buy educational courses from them. Udemy is in the top 5 most commonly used online schools 
for short, niche, educational, instructional courses taught by people who are actually finanacially 
successful in the industry they are teaching. This clone displays the features and benefits of using 
Udemy to advance your career and your life-long learning ambitions. It also provides several useful 
'quickLinks' to their commonly visited webpages, links to download their app, and also helpful links 
to their commonly requested FAQ pages.
